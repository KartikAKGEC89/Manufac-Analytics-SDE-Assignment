# Manufac Analytics - SDE Assignment

This project implements analytics over the Indian Agriculture dataset provided by the National Data and Analytics Platform (NITI Aayog). It processes and displays the data in two tables using Mantine 5 in a React application. The goal is to provide insights on crop production and average yield/cultivation area over the years.

## Task Description

1. **Data Processing**:
   - **Yearly Analysis**:
     - A table will show the crop with the **maximum** and **minimum** production for each year from 1950 to 2020.
   - **Crop Analysis**:
     - A table will display the **average yield** and **average cultivation area** of each crop between 1950 and 2020.

2. **Frontend Implementation**:
   - **Table Implementation**: Both tables are implemented using Mantine 5, as per the requirements.
   - **Handling Missing Data**: Any missing values in the dataset are treated as **0** during data processing.
   - **No External Libraries**: No helper libraries like Bootstrap, jQuery, or Lodash are used.

3. **Final Output**:
   - Upon running `yarn dev`, the browser will open and render the page with the required tables displaying the analytics.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite, Mantine 5
- **Data Processing**: Plain TypeScript (No external data manipulation libraries)
- **Styling**: Custom CSS (No external styling libraries)
